# ReplyScraper
Repo for Tweet reply scraper via the Twitter API

# Todo:
At the moment the post-scraping analytics is carried out after the replies are written to the csv file. 
e.g. Duplicates are then simply identified via a conditional formatting function in any spreadsheet application.
Will automate this into the script when I have time.
